        <title>Hello World!</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   Hello there! By some force mysterious to most of us, you've stumbled upon the first ever blog post
   on my shiny new website! Thank you for that, I hope this website could serve you some kind of use and I hope you enjoy your
   stay, however short or long that may be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-subtitle&quot;&gt; How I'm Winging it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   As I was first writing this post I wanted it to be a professional, decisive and well thought out
   overview explaining what I want this website to be and what kind of content I intend to have on it. To be completely honest though,
   I mostly started this out because the idea seemed like fun. But at the end of the day, I'm sure &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt; was the reason many 
   code monkeys ended spending a large part of the prime of their lives passionately working on many successful open source projects
   which now power a staggering amount of multimillion-dollar companies worldwide.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   So while I may still only have a vague idea of what kind of content I want this website to have and in what direction I want
   it to go, I'll at least have fun writing it. Maybe, you'll get a kick out of reading it too. True to this website's motto, and what
   is pretty much everything I've been doing ever since I learnt how to program and read from Stackoverflow, I'll be winging it.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-subtitle&quot;&gt; Content &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   Most of the content on this website will be related to whatever project I'm working on or technology I'm interested in at that point of time.
   I'm interested in a lot of things though so the number of categories on this website is definitely going to explode. For the moment, I'm planning on
   focusing on &lt;i&gt;AI &amp; Machine Learning&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;programming tutorials or guides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;microcontrollers &amp; robotics&lt;/i&gt; and filling what I think is an in-demand niche,
   &lt;i&gt;Unicenta oPOS&lt;/i&gt; extension and development.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   Of course, the content won't just be limited to those and could theoretically be about anything and everything under the Computer Science related Sun. For example, maybe 
   I would even touch on the glory that is VIM vs the kind-of-okay-but-why-do-you-have-weird-keyboard-shortcuts-bro EMACS, or maybe even guides on how to get the most out of Git and GitHub. I suppose what I really want
   out of this website is to learn more about any tech related topic by teaching about it. Also, I hear there's this thing about developers needing to &quot;work on their brand&quot; or something like that, 
   but that doesn't sound nearly as altruistic ;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-subtitle&quot;&gt; So what makes this website so special? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   I'm the one writing it. &quot;How is that special?&quot; you may ask. It isn't :D. but maybe in the future I'll be the next Bill Gates or Linus Torvalds and you can gloat to all your friends
   that you read my things way before I made it big ;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   On a more serious note, I intend on making each post as accessible to the beginner developer as possible while at the same time keeping it concise and informative to more
   experienced developers. I have a few ideas on how to get that done and it defintiely won't be easy, but it sounds like it could be fun to try.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-subtitle&quot;&gt; Closing words &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blogpost-text&quot;&gt;
   If this website helps out even one person to solve a problem or to know more about something they're interested in, then I consider the hard work worth it. Stick around and check back
   once in a while to see what new posts I've cooked up if you're interested. Follow me on twitter if you want updates on new posts or if you want to say hi. I'll probably set up a mailing list
   in the future if the website gains any kind of popularity but for now, check back often if anything I talked about interests you and I hope you come by again soon :)
